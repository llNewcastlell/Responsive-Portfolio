                        then? That's right, yeah! I got some old debts I've got to pay off with this stuff. Even if I didn't,
                        you don't think I'd be fool enough to stick around here, do you? Why don't you come with us? You're
                        pretty good in a fight. I could use you. Come on! Why don't you take a look around? You know what's
                        about to happen, what they're up against. They could use a good pilot like you. You're turning your
                        back on them.

                        The battle station is heavily shielded and carries a firepower greater than half the star fleet. It's defenses are designed
                        around a direct large-scale assault. A small one-man fighter should be able to penetrate the outer
                        defense. Pardon me for asking, sir, but what good are snub fighters going to be against that? Well,
                        the Empire doesn't consider a small one-man fighter to be any threat, or they'd have a tighter defense.
                        An analysis of the plans provided by Princess Leia has demonstrated a weakness in the battle station.

                        Hey, whoa, just where do you think you're going? Master Luke here is your rightful owner. We'll have no more of this Obi-Wan
                        Kenobi jibberish...and don't talk to me about your mission, either. You're fortunate he doesn't blast
                        you into a million pieces right here. What's wrong with him now? Oh my...sir, he says there are several
                        creatures approaching from the southeast. Sandpeople! Or worst! Come on, let's have a look. Come
                        on. There are two Banthas down there but I don't see any...wait a second, they're Sandpeople all
                        right. I can see one of them now.
